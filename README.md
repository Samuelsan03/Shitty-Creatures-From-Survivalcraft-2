# Npc-mod-from-survivalcraft-2
This is a pseudo mod for SurvivalCraft 2, and it's my first time creating anything for the game. If you notice any mistakes, feel free to let me know—I'm still learning and trying to understand how everything works.

The mod introduces a mix of human-like and non-human creatures, each with unique behaviors and traits. Some descriptions include dark humor, meant to be playful and provocative, while others are more neutral. The names of the entities follow the same pattern—some are absurd or satirical, others are straightforward.

Beyond that, the mod is experimental. It doesn’t rely on external assets yet, just internal XML edits and template manipulation. It’s designed to be modular, so future expansions or chapters can build on it. The goal isn’t balance or realism, but creative exploration and symbolic expression. If you’re familiar with entity templates or GUID structuring, your feedback would be especially helpful.
