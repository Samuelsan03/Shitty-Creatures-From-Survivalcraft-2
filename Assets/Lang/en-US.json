    "Description": {
      "InfectedWerewolf": "The Infected Werewolf is the result of an infected creature’s bite upon a human or a werewolf. The transformation is immediate, creating a more powerful, faster, and far more dangerous version than the original werewolf. It belongs to the infected faction, joins hordes, and may appear in massive waves during special events. Its strength is overwhelming, its endurance superior, and its ferocity unstoppable. Its glowing eyes radiate an unnatural light that signals impending destruction. However, legend claims that if you give it the Zombie Collar, it will cease being hostile toward you and will protect you anywhere, becoming a relentless guardian against any threat.",
      "InfectedWolf": "The Infected Wolf is created when an infected creature bites a common gray wolf. The result is an enhanced, stronger, and fully hostile version of the original wolf, now part of the infected faction. It is tougher, more aggressive, and relentless in pursuit. It can join infected packs and even appear in devastating waves during the Green Night. Its instincts drive it to hunt without mercy, attacking players and other creatures alike. Yet legend says that if you offer it the Zombie Collar, the Infected Wolf will acknowledge you as its master and become your eternal guardian, fighting by your side and protecting you even in the darkest nights.",
      "MachineGunInfected": "Do you think that defeating the final bosses such as the normal Tanks and the Ghost Tanks means you’re safe? Think again this is the true final boss. The Machine Gun Infected is a special type of infected who, unlike the others, has learned to wield heavy firearms, most notably the Minigun. Once he sees you as prey, he becomes an ultra-dangerous threat, unleashing relentless fire until you are dead. He is part of the infected group, and facing him alongside his squad is nearly suicidal: if you attack his allies, you won’t last long. Stronger and tougher than the muscular infected, he appears on Day 95 at night, when you are expected to have full gear, armor, and guardians armed to the teeth. His design is inspired by Hambone, the boss from the 1998 arcade game CarnEvil, as his skin, mask, clothing, and weapon bear a striking resemblance like twin brothers walking different paths. Yet he can be tamed with the zombie collar, becoming a guardian specialized in firearms. Under your command, his Minigun becomes your most devastating defense… though his overwhelming power may just as easily turn into your downfall.",
      "GhostCharger": "The Ghost Charger is a spectral variant of the infected, specializing in charge attacks. Unlike the normal Charger, it not only retains its powerful impact but also possesses enhanced durability and partial invisibility, making its attacks harder to predict. Its charges are more devastating than those of a regular Charger: a single impact can knock down multiple targets and suppress them with greater force. The invisibility allows it to approach undetected, making every encounter fraught with sudden danger. Despite its fearsome nature, it can be tamed with the zombie collar, turning it into a spectral guardian. Yet controlling such an aggressive ally always carries risks: its immense power may become your greatest advantage… or your downfall.",
      "TankGhost1": "The Ghost Tank is a spectral variant of the most feared infected. Unlike the normal Tank, it wields even greater strength and superior endurance, able to shatter armor and bring down enemies with a single strike. Its massive build combined with its ghostly nature makes it harder to anticipate and far deadlier in battle. Its most terrifying ability is hurling phantom boulders, projectiles that tear through the air with immense force and can decide the fight instantly. The partial invisibility surrounding it makes it unpredictable, forcing players to remain constantly alert. Like other infected, it can be tamed with the zombie collar, turning into a spectral guardian. Yet controlling such a destructive ally is a gamble: its immense power may become your greatest weapon… or your downfall.",
      "GhostBoomer1": "The Ghost Boomer is a massive spectral creature, grotesque in form and concealed by its invisibility, making it hard to detect. Its greatest danger lies in the fact that upon death, it unleashes a spectral explosion that devastates everything nearby. This makes every encounter a deadly gamble—killing it too close can wipe out you and your allies. Legends claim that with the zombie collar, it can be tamed and turned into a guardian. Yet even under your control, the risk remains: its explosion may destroy everything around it. To tame it is to embrace danger, a choice only for those willing to gamble with destruction.",
      "PoisonousGhost": "The Poisonous Ghost, similar to the regular ghost, shares the same spectral nature but possesses a toxic ability that makes it even more dangerous. Its most lethal trait is its poisonous touch: if it manages to catch you, it injects a deadly toxin that slowly drains your health over time. This makes it a formidable foe, as even escaping its grasp does not guarantee safety. The only way to detect its presence and anticipate an attack is by listening to the sounds it produces and, most importantly, the chase music that signals its approach. Like other infected, it can be tamed with the zombie collar, turning it into a guardian at your side.",
      "GhostFast": "The Ghost Fast, much like the regular ghost, shares the same spectral nature but possesses speed as its defining ability. It is faster than even the swiftest infected, making it a formidable foe to evade. Its most dangerous trait is invisibility, which makes it extremely difficult to spot. The only way to detect its presence and anticipate an attack is by listening to the sounds it produces and, most importantly, the chase music that signals its approach. Like other infected, it can be tamed with the zombie collar, turning it into a guardian at your side.",
      "Bandit1": "A bandit is a dangerous human you never know what you’ll run into. It’s a serious mistake to underestimate them or assume they might help you, because if they spot you, they can kill you instantly. There are two types: those armed with firearms and those wielding melee weapons. Both are deadly, but if you manage to defeat them, you can loot their weapons and use them as your own. However, not all are hostile: some may offer you a deal to become your guards, and if you accept, they can protect you.",
      "GhostNormal": "The Ghost is a special infected that belongs to the group of infected. Its unique ability is opacity: its silhouette is barely visible, making it a deadly and almost invisible hunter. If it tries to kill you or manages to catch you, it becomes your greatest danger, as you will rarely know where it is. Like normal and muscular infected, it can also wield melee and ranged weapons, which makes it even more unpredictable. Its invisibility makes it the most dangerous enemy when its location is unknown, and the only way to detect it is through the sounds it emits or the tense music that signals its presence. The Ghost appears on day 4 at night, always lurking in the shadows. Do not be deceived: facing it means choosing between seeking refuge to avoid certain death, devising clever traps such as spikes to catch it, or taming it with the zombie collar to turn it into your invisible slave. Yet a tamed Ghost is a double-edged weapon, for its invisibility may be your greatest advantage or your downfall if it slips from your control and turns against you. Only the most cunning survivors can harness it without falling into their own trap.",
      "Tank1": "The Tank is a special infected that surpasses all others in strength and endurance. Its massive build allows it to kill with a single blow, and its deadliest ability is hurling mysterious rocks if one strikes you, your fate is sealed. It is named “Tank” because, like a war machine, it possesses near-impenetrable resistance and devastating power. It appears on day 41, at any time, day or night, and always alone, making it a unique challenge. To face it, you’ll need strong armor and powerful weapons capable of withstanding its brutal attacks. Like other infected, its rage can be subdued with the zombie collar, allowing you to tame it and turn it into your protective slave. Can you truly harness the advantages of having a Tank under your command? Its immense power may become your greatest weapon… or your downfall.",
      "Charger1": "The Charger is another type of infected, distinguished by its massively thick and powerful arm on one side, while the other remains normal. Its deadliest attack is a brutal charge, capable not only of killing you but also of hurling you with the force of an American football player. It appears on day 19 at night, usually in pairs, making them even more dangerous. Arm yourself well to defeat them, or obtain the zombie collar, for legend says it can tame them and turn them into your guardians.",
      "Boomer1": "The Boomer is another type of infected, known for its massive size and grotesque appearance. Its most distinctive trait is that upon death it explodes, making it a deadly threat: kill it too close, and you’ll be blown to pieces. Yet legend says that with the zombie collar it can become an ally. If you manage to tame it, the Boomer will serve as your guardian. You will gain control over it and can take advantage of its abilities, though there is always the risk of it dying in an explosion. Try it at your own risk, but never near other zombies or allies, as they could perish in the blast.",
      "FlyingInfectedBoss": "The Flying Infected Boss is another type of flying infected, but what truly sets it apart is its four heads, making it a terrifying monster. Its greatest danger lies in the variety of its attacks: it can strike normally, throw fire, or throw poison, making it extremely hazardous. As a true boss, it appears on day 31 at any time, and its most threatening trait is speed, being far faster than regular infected. Therefore, you must prepare strong weapons to defeat it. Legend says the zombie collar can calm its rage. In this way, the Flying Infected Boss can be tamed and become your first enslaved boss. What advantages will you gain from it?",
      "InfectedFly1": "The Flying Infected is another type of zombie, but unlike others, this one can fly. How did it become an infected bird? Perhaps chemical experiments mixing humans and birds led to this result. They appear on the 9th night, always flying in groups of three. Be careful, as flying enemies are harder to kill. However, as the legend says, if you use the zombie collar on one of them, they will become your guardian slaves useful when you cannot reach your flying target.",
      "PoisonousInfected1": "The Normal Infected looks just like an ordinary zombie, with the same appearance and initial behavior as any other. It moves clumsily and blends in among the rest without raising suspicion, which makes many underestimate it at first sight. It begins to appear on day 6 at night, usually in small groups, and its presence seems no different from other infected. Yet, some survivors claim that after fighting what seemed to be a “normal zombie,” something unusual happens to their health. It is said that with the zombie collar, even these infected could stop being enemies and become allies.",
      "InfectedMuscle1": "The Muscle Infected is a more imposing version of the normal zombie. Its body is marked by exaggerated muscles, the result of the infection that turned it into a brute of raw strength. Unlike other infected, it does not rely solely on physical power: it can also wield weapons, both melee and ranged, making it a doubly dangerous foe. It begins to appear after day 3 at night, and will continue to spawn afterwards, usually alone or accompanied by another Muscle Infected. Its strike is devastating: a single blow can break improvised defenses and leave the player vulnerable. In addition, its ability to wield weapons makes it unpredictable, alternating between brutal punches and armed assaults. Provoking it is a mistake few survive. However, there is a legend that speaks of the possibility of taming it with a zombie collar. If you manage to place it, the Muscle Infected will cease to be your enemy and become your guardian. From that moment on, its overwhelming strength will be on your side, protecting you and facing any threat with ferocity. Some tales claim that tamed Muscle Infected show unwavering loyalty, obeying simple commands and using their power to defend their master. Others insist they can break obstacles and clear paths where no other infected could. Its strength, resilience, and ability to use weapons make facing it a deadly challenge. You will need luck and good weapons to defeat it… or courage to try to tame it.",
      "InfectedFast1": "The Fast Infected is a variant of the normal zombie, but with a skill that makes it even more dangerous: speed. Unlike other infected, it does not use weapons, but compensates for this by running faster than any similar creature. It begins to appear on day 2 at night, and will continue to spawn afterwards, always in small groups of two infected, no more. This makes it a constant threat, as their speed allows them to surround and attack before the player can react. Provoking them is a serious mistake, as their instinct is to devour brains and the darkness gives them an advantage to ambush relentlessly. However, there is a legend that speaks of the possibility of taming them: if you manage to place a zombie collar on a Fast Infected, it will cease to be your enemy and instead join your group. From that moment on, it becomes your guardian, using its speed to protect you, chase enemies, and act as a tireless sentinel. Some tales claim that tamed Fast Infected develop a special bond with their master, obeying simple commands and reacting quickly to any threat. Others insist they can detect movement from great distances, anticipating attacks before they happen. Although they do not carry weapons, their strength and resilience combined with their speed make facing them a risky challenge. You will need luck and good weapons to defeat them… or courage to try to tame them.",
      "InfectedNormal1": "The Normal Infected is a hostile creature that attacks indiscriminately, appearing from the very beginning of the world. They can spawn in packs of two or three, increasing the danger of encountering them. Provoking one is a fatal mistake, as it will attempt to devour your brain without mercy. At night, their threat intensifies, as that is when they seek to feed on everyone they find. Despite their danger, there is a legend of a strange item: the zombie collar. It is said that if you manage to place it on a Normal Infected, it will cease to be your enemy and instead join your group. From that moment on, it becomes your guardian, protecting you from other foes and attacking anyone who dares approach. Some tales claim that Infected turned into guardians develop a bond with their master, recognizing their presence and obeying simple commands. Others insist they can even sense danger before it happens, acting as silent sentinels. However, obtaining a zombie collar is no easy task—few have ever found one, and even fewer have survived to tell the tale. They may look like ordinary zombies you’ve seen in other mods, right? Yet despite that, they can wield both melee and ranged weapons, and even destroy everything in their path. Their strength and resilience make facing them risky, so you’ll need luck and good weapons to defeat them… or courage to try to tame them.",
      "PirataNormal": "The Pirata Normal is a common pirate who always follows the orders of the Capitán Pirata. Although he lacks the strength of the more powerful ones, he is still dangerous, as he enjoys creating chaos and shows hatred toward anything in his path. His unpredictable behavior makes him a constant threat. The worst part is that he always carries weapons, ranging from rusty swords to improvised knives, and he does not hesitate to use them against anyone who stands in his way. At times, he has been seen attacking without reason, simply for amusement or to prove his loyalty to the captain. In battles, Pirata Normals often appear in large numbers, forming the backbone of the crew and fighting in groups, which increases the risk of facing them. Because of their dangerous antics, fighting them is difficult, though not as deadly as the Pirata Élite or the captain himself. Still, they should not be underestimated: their strength in numbers and aggressiveness can overwhelm you if you are not prepared. Good luck—you’ll need strong weapons to bring him down.",
      "PirataElite": "The Pirata Élite is regarded as the most dangerous shadow of the sea. It is said he was trained from a young age by the Capitan Pirata himself, mastering combat tactics and absolute obedience. His presence commands respect: wherever he appears, silence falls and other pirates keep their distance. Some tales claim the Pirata Élite never sleeps, always watching the surroundings with eyes fixed on potential threats. Others say he carries scars from countless battles, each one a testament to his resilience. His loyalty to the captain makes him a fearsome servant, willing to give his life without hesitation. His strength and resilience make facing him risky, so you’ll need luck and good weapons to bring him down.",
      "CapitanPirata": "The Capitán Pirata is the ultimate leader of the pirate crew. His covered eye is not a sign of weakness, but rather a symbol of sharp vision and battle-hardened experience. He has always been feared by the pirate slaves, for when his ship or crew are threatened, he orders an immediate attack. If his men are wounded, he takes up arms himself, fighting with skill far greater than any other. Facing him head-on is a deadly challenge—you will need the best weapons to stand a chance. Be warned, he is the most lethal of them all. Yet defeating him yields valuable rewards. What treasures will fall from his grasp upon death? That mystery drives many to risk everything against him.",
      "PirataHostilComerciante": "The Pirata Hostil Comerciante is perhaps the only neutral pirate within the pirate faction. If provoked, he will attack, but the advantage is that he allows trading, offering items ranging from basic supplies to rare and valuable goods in exchange for iron ingots. To make a purchase, if you encounter him with his group, do not attempt to fight them, as you risk being attacked by all of them at once. The safest way to trade is to use a whistle to call him and make him appear away from his group; this way, you can begin trading without confrontation. It is said that this pirate was cast aside by his own crew due to his unpredictable nature. Not fitting entirely within the rules of the others, he turned to commerce as a means of survival. Though hostile by nature, he found in trading a way to maintain his position and earn respect. His neutrality makes him unique: dangerous if challenged, but valuable if approached with caution.",
      "PirataEliteAliado": "The Pirata Élite Aliado was once part of the crew of the Capitan Pirata, but unlike other sailors, he survived thanks to his greater endurance and strength. With 350 HP, he is far more difficult to defeat and has earned a reputation as a relentless fighter. During battles in the Caribbean waters, he proved capable of withstanding blows that would have ended any other pirate, allowing him to escape deadly situations and remain alive. The Pirata Élite Aliado does not belong to the factions of the Alliance, Death, or Pirates, but he can become an ally of the player, offering constant protection day and night. He can only be found in stone houses with a 90% chance, starting on day 9 at any time, always within the mentioned structures. His presence is rarer than that of the Pirata Normal Aliado, but also more valuable due to his power and resilience. If you do not wish to wait for his appearance, he can be obtained from the Pirata Hostil Comerciante for 100 iron ingots. Though expensive, his usefulness makes the cost worthwhile: he not only protects the player but also delivers stronger attacks against nearby enemies and resists prolonged ambushes. It is said he keeps a small arsenal of improvised weapons for combat, showing his ingenuity and preparation. The Pirata Élite Aliado is without doubt a formidable guardian, turning any home into a fortress.",
      "PirataNormalAliado": "The Pirata Normal Aliado was once part of the crew of the Capitan Pirata, where the treatment of sailors was far from ideal. He was mistreated if he failed to follow orders, and at times food was denied without reason. During a war in the waters of the Caribbean, a careless moment caused him to fall from the ship of the Capitan Pirata, allowing the captain and some crew members to escape while others were left behind. The Pirata Normal Aliado managed to swim to another island in search of help. Despite his appearance, this pirate does not belong to the factions of the Alliance, Death, or Pirates. However, he can become an ally of the player, protecting them day and night in their home. He can be found in certain wooden houses with a 100% chance, or in stone houses with a 50% chance, starting on day 4 at any time, but only within the mentioned structures. If you do not wish to wait for his appearance, he can be obtained from the Pirata Hostil Comerciante for 35 iron ingots.",
      "Naomi": "Naomi (ナオミ). A mystery to solve. She is Japanese, but… is she truly human or robotic? How did she arrive on the island of Survivalcraft 2? A tremendous mystery. It begins in Kyoto, with an inventor named Takachi (高智). In 1999, Naomi was created because Takachi needed an automatic assistant for biological scientific research. The prototype tests went well, and the final result looked human. Since then, the robot has been successful in performing both complex and simple tasks. One day, Takachi received a research project from Kyoto University to investigate new species and rare places outside of Japan. Needing companionship, he chose Naomi as his partner. Halfway across the sea, Takachi accidentally dropped his humanoid robot Naomi into the water, causing panic. He feared the robot was damaged due to its electrical components, but what he didn’t know was that Naomi was water-resistant. This led Naomi to a mysterious island or large continent. From that day, her life as a humanoid robot changed. How will she survive without resources? Previously, she had practiced survival skills during their research trips. Will she need the player’s help? You’ll find out in the game!",
      "Ricardo": "Ricardo is an ordinary civilian from Tlatelolco, born on June 4, 1998. Since childhood, he enjoyed walking like a playful dog and felt a deep connection to nature, always dreaming of traveling to islands. In 2021, the University of Tlatelolco offered him a place in a scientific-biological research program to explore islands outside of Mexico. He seized the opportunity and joined the expedition. During the journey across the Pacific Ocean, violent waves and strong winds endangered the crew. Ricardo was swept away by the wind into the water, and his companions, seeing him far away without a lifebuoy, believed he had drowned. Yet fortune favored him: the currents carried him to an unknown island, one not marked on the Pacific maps. Awakening there, Ricardo had to find ways to survive. One night, while exploring, he encountered Naomi, a humanoid robot who had faced a similar fate. From that moment, they became friends.",
      "Paco": "What the hell did that man come out of, it seems that the aliens brought him. This was a phrase said by a human who saw him in a city somewhere in Mexico. Paco is a human-alien created by a Martian race in 1968, when the Soviet Union launched another expedition to compete against the United States. During that mission, some crew members saw a red light coming from another planet and traveled to investigate beyond the Moon. What they discovered was the creation of a being almost human but with alien traits, possessing intelligence superior to a normal human. Things changed in 2001, when Russia (no longer the USSR after its dissolution in 1991) entered into war with the United States due to a misunderstanding: supposed terrorists had destroyed one of their ships near Mars. A solar conflict erupted, reminiscent of Star Wars, and Paco’s alien creators saw their home planet under attack. Fearing destruction, they armed themselves, and both nations also had to face them. In a mishap, Russia shot an alien holding a ship’s control device, breaking it and injuring the alien. This caused the ship to drift away automatically, carrying Paco and his two clones. They eventually arrived on Earth, landing on a mysterious, unidentified island in the Pacific Ocean—the same island where Naomi and Ricardo had fallen. There, they sought ways to survive. Later, Paco encountered Naomi and Ricardo. At first, they thought each other threats, but they became friends after Paco demonstrated survival skills far more advanced than theirs.",
      "Barack": "Barack, as some Russians and Americans affirmed after the alien war of 2001, was said to be a twin brother similar to Paco. Unlike Paco, Barack was a devoted follower of Barack Obama, who would later become President of the United States in 2008 and take office in January 2009. In the game’s world, you can hear references to Obama, showing that Barack is his number one fan. Barack, Paco’s twin brother, arrived on one of the mysterious islands where Paco had fallen, though his origin dates back to July 7, 1980. He was created by the same alien race as Paco, but the reason he was brought to Earth was different: the aliens sought to recover their lost child, yet instead they remained. This forged a deep connection between Barack and Paco. Like Paco, Barack had to survive on the unknown island, facing the same trials of nature and destiny. Eventually, he too encountered Naomi and Ricardo, and although suspicion marked their first meeting, they became allies after proving their survival skills and intelligence. As a curiosity, Barack later founded the group 'Alianza', dedicated to searching for survivors who fall onto the mysterious Pacific islands, while scientists—especially Russians and Americans—investigate obsessively what these islands are called and where they are located.",
      "ElMarihuanero": "Known as 'El Marihuanero', he is remembered as Paco’s missing link brother, a mysterious survivor whose origins trace back to the same alien experiments that created Paco. His strength is moderate compared to Paco’s, but his cunning and adaptability make him a formidable presence on the islands. The nickname 'El Marihuanero' was not given lightly: during his wanderings across the Pacific islands, he discovered wild cannabis plants growing in hidden valleys. Fascinated by their properties, he began cultivating them and claimed they gave him clarity, endurance, and a strange bond with nature. This obsession eventually tied him symbolically to Mexico, where cannabis culture and folklore became part of his identity. Over time, he also embraced the Rastafari movement, adopting its philosophy of unity, resistance, and spiritual connection, and looked to Jamaica as a cultural homeland. Legends say that he carried seeds wherever he traveled, planting them as markers of his journey. Though at first distrusted by Naomi, Ricardo, and Paco, he proved his loyalty and resourcefulness, showing survival skills that rivaled his brother’s. His blows were not as strong as Paco’s, but his strategies and resilience often turned the tide in desperate situations. Over time, El Marihuanero became a figure of curiosity and myth, remembered not only for his alien-human heritage but also for the plants, the Rastafari ideals, and the Jamaican spirit that defined his name and destiny on the mysterious Pacific islands.",
      "ElMarihuaneroMamon": "Another missing link brother of Paco and twin brother of El Marihuanero, this one is more muscular and physically imposing. His raw attack power is lower than Paco’s, but his endurance and brute strength make him a dangerous opponent. Unlike his twin, he dedicated himself to mastering the musket. His story begins when he discovered an abandoned colonial outpost on one of the mysterious Pacific islands. Inside, he found old weapon crates and manuals left behind by explorers and soldiers from centuries past. Fascinated, he spent years studying the mechanisms of the musket, practicing its loading, aiming, and firing until he became an expert marksman. His discipline and patience turned him into a skilled hunter and defender, able to strike with precision even under harsh conditions. Survivors who encountered him learned to fear his musket more than his fists, for his shots could tear enemies apart within seconds. Legends say he carried the musket everywhere, treating it as both weapon and symbol of survival. Eventually, he crossed paths with Paco, Naomi, and Ricardo, and though suspicion marked their first meetings, his mastery of firearms earned him respect among the group.",
      "FumadorQuimico": "Her outfit suggests she has experience in chemical and toxic environments. Although she looks threatening, she is part of the Alianza group meaning she supports her team when attacked or harmed by enemies. She possesses a mysterious hidden power: during a full moon or new moon, she transforms into a giant muscular mutant (similar to a Tank), gaining enhanced strength, greater resistance, and other abilities.",
      "FumadorQuimicoBrawny": "More powerful, stronger than its original form, it will only be available on a full moon or new moon",
      "TommyVercetti": "A violent and ambitious figure in the criminal world, known for his rise from the Forelli family in Liberty City. Originally of Italian descent, he now resides in Vice City, Florida, where he built his own empire after a failed drug deal in 1986. Despite his reputation, he is also part of the Alliance group, supporting and defending his allies when threatened by rival gangs or hostile forces.",
      "ClaudeSpeed": "A silent and ruthless criminal, known for his efficiency and lack of mercy. Born in Liberty City, he rose through the ranks of the criminal underworld, becoming a feared figure in the city. Despite his violent nature, he is part of the Alliance group, supporting and defending his allies when threatened by rival gangs or hostile forces.",
      "LaMuerteX": "La Muerte X emerged from the violet infernal shadows, with skin and behavior forged in darkness. He is far from friendly his hostile nature drives him to destroy anything in his path. Approach him, and he will hunt you relentlessly… until death. His powers range from moderately strong physical strikes to deadly flame attacks; if you try to escape, he will launch fireballs at you. In the worst case, he hurls magical rocks that inflict devastating damage.",
      "ElSenorDeLasTumbasMoradas": "What a surprise, I suppose. El Señor De Las Tumbas Moradas is the closest companion of La Muerte X they’re always together, always helping one another. But El Señor De Las Tumbas Moradas has received some mysterious upgrades beyond his friend. What kind of power does he hide? What attacks might he unleash? Could he summon something darker when threatened? That’s for you to find out. (Let’s just say you’ll understand once you face him yourself.) But be warned: if you strike him, he won’t forgive you. He’ll drag you down into the purple tombs and from that moment on, you’ll become his eternal slave in the shadows. He won’t be your friend not because he hates you, but because friendship was never part of his design.",
      "LiderCalavericoSupremo": "Who is the true ruler of darkness and tombs? It's none other than Líder Calavérico Supremo the highest and most fearsome leader of this world. At first glance, he may seem underwhelming, with attacks that appear weak... but don't be fooled. His speed rivals that of a cheetah, and when the full moon or new moon rises, he transforms into a monstrous force of nature. His mutated form might remind you of a Tank. Could he be a worthy rival to Fumador Químico Brawny in terms of brute strength, raw impact, and sheer chaos? That's a question only battle can answer.",
      "LiderCalavericoSupremoAlfa": "He’s not just a threat he’s a declaration of war. Líder Calavérico Supremo Alfa is the mid-tier juggernaut of the tomb realm, a refined beast forged from chaos and vengeance. Stronger than most, faster than many, and meaner than you’d expect, he’s the kind of enemy that doesn’t wait for introductions. His attacks? Heavy and relentless. His speed? Almost unnatural. And when the moon shifts be it full or new he mutates into something far more dangerous. Some say his form resembles a Tank. Others wonder if he’s meant to rival Fumador Químico Brawny in raw strength, impact, and destruction. Want to know for sure? Then set the stage and watch them clash. Just don’t try it in Creative Mode—that’s like watching a storm from behind bulletproof glass. Líder Calavérico Supremo Alfa is not your ally. He’s not here to talk, negotiate, or join your cause. He is your enemy. And if you’re not ready… he’ll make sure you never get the chance to be.",
      "Conker": "Conker is a squirrel with a cute appearance but a cynical, opportunistic, and shameless personality. While most people know him from Conker’s Bad Fur Day, his origin was very different: he first appeared in 1997 as a child-friendly character and starred in a beta project called Twelve Tales: Conker 64, originally designed as a colorful game for kids. That concept was later scrapped and radically transformed. The result is a character who drinks, insults, manipulates, and acts purely out of self-interest. He doesn’t seek justice, adventure, or redemption he survives simply because he does, with no clear purpose, no ethics, and no empathy. His speech is crude and mocking, and his attitude reflects total indifference to the chaos around him. Conker isn’t a hero or a villain; he’s a survivor who crawls forward for his own gain, completely at odds with his cartoonish design.",
      "Beavis": "Beavis is a teenage boy with a nervous laugh, broken speech, and a volatile personality. He’s impulsive, emotionally unstable, and easily distracted, often triggered by fire, violence, or loud music. He speaks in short, repetitive phrases and acts without thinking, showing no awareness of consequences. Controversially, Beavis became the focus of criticism after the episode 'Comedians' aired in 1993, when his fascination with fire was linked by commentators and comedians to real-life incidents, sparking debates about whether the show irresponsibly glorified dangerous behavior or simply reflected absurd teenage impulses. Though he often follows Butt-Head, he’s not just a sidekick; he has unpredictable outbursts, especially when he transforms into his hyperactive alter ego 'Cornholio,' obsessing over toilet paper and speaking incoherently. Beavis doesn’t seek meaning, control, or purpose. He survives simply because he does, unaware of the damage he causes or the world around him.",
      "Butt-Head": "Butt-Head is a teenage boy with a deep, slow laugh, slurred speech, and a smug personality. He’s lazy, sarcastic, and often cruel, showing little empathy or intelligence. He speaks in short, mocking phrases and usually manipulates situations to amuse himself, rarely thinking beyond the moment. Controversially, Butt-Head became the center of debate after the episode 'Comedians' aired in 1993, when critics and comedians argued whether his character represented sharp satire of teenage apathy or simply glorified stupidity and crude humor, raising questions about comedy’s responsibility in shaping youth culture. Though he often leads Beavis, he’s not just a leader; he has his own reckless impulses, especially when he provokes chaos for amusement, laughing at pain or destruction. Butt-Head doesn’t seek meaning, growth, or responsibility. He exists simply to ridicule, unaware of the harm he causes or the emptiness of his actions.",
      "HombreLava": "Hombre Lava is a powerful creature that blends into the crowd until provoked. If you get too close, expect to be burned by his melee strikes. Try to run, and you’ll be hunted down by fireballs hurled with deadly precision. He belongs to the Muerte faction, so if you're part of Alianza, you'd better gear up with weapons beyond standard Survivalcraft 2 gear unless you're packing a musket, explosives, or an explosive crossbow, you're likely toast. Fire and magma are his allies; burning him only fuels his rage. His one true weakness is water submersion slows him, weakens his flame core, and eventually extinguishes his power. He avoids rivers, panics in rain, and takes heavy damage from splash-based weapons. If you want to survive an encounter, lure him into wet terrain and strike fast before he reignites.",
      "HombreAgua": "Hombre Agua is calm but deadly. He hides in rivers and rain, striking with freezing bursts and crushing waves. Fire heals him. Explosives barely scratch him. His body flows like liquid—hard to hit, harder to stop. He’s part of Muerte, and fights beside his best brother, Hombre Lava. Together, they cover land and water, burning and drowning anything in their way. If you’re Alianza, bring lightning, frost, or stay far away. Wet terrain is his home. Dry ground is your only chance.",
      "ElBallestador": "l Ballestador isn’t the strongest fighter, but don’t let that fool you—his cursed bow never leaves his side. He’s not part of your Alianza and belongs to Muerte, standing out as the only human in his faction wielding a possessed weapon. His arrows are fast, silent, and unforgiving. Confront him or try to escape—either way, you’re already dead. If he sees you, he fires. If you move, he hits. His diamond arrows pierce almost everything, except the rhino, beluga, and orca, who can endure more hits if they fight back. To survive, use terrain to break his line of sight. Zigzag when running, jump unpredictably, and never stay still. If you’re solo, bait his shot and rush in before he reloads. In a group, flank while one teammate draws fire. Splash damage or shock can disrupt his aim, but timing is everything. If you hear the click of his bow, it might already be too late. They say his bow was forged in silence, bound to him after he survived a betrayal that left him voiceless. Since then, it’s been his only companion—never speaks, never misses, never leaves. That’s why he trusts it more than any ally. He appears only at night starting from day 5, and during these nights players can set traps to capture his bows and ammunition, turning his own arsenal into a valuable resource.",
      "HeadcrabBloodyHuman": "A more aggressive and blood-soaked variant of the standard headcrab. The Bloody Headcrab features torn exoskeletal tissue, soaked in hemolymph and exposed muscle fibers, likely caused by radiation or failed bioweapon experiments. It moves faster, jumps farther, and attaches to hosts with brutal force, triggering near-instant zombification. Its screech is sharper, and its presence often signals high-contamination zones. Not recommended for low-tier encounters.",
      "ElArquero": "Twin brother of El Ballestador, El Arquero excels in pinpoint accuracy and rapid-fire archery using reinforced bows. Both share tactical agility, night vision, and synchronized patrol behavior, but El Arquero favors elevated ambushes and silent strikes. His armor is lighter, allowing swift movement across high structures. He communicates through optical signals and rarely misses a shot. Like El Ballestador, he is highly dangerous—provoking him will result in a lethal barrage of arrows. Upon death, he drops usable bow-grade arrows, ideal if you're low on resources. To survive, use cover, bait his shots, and flank from blind angles to avoid direct line-of-sight. Curiously, El Arquero began using his bow after witnessing his brother fire a bow for the first time. Wanting to defend himself equally, he stole a bow and arrows from a weapons shop—giving rise to a hostile Robin Hood of the high ground. He appears only at night starting from day 10, making his encounters rarer but significantly more threatening as the world grows darker.",
    "ArqueroPrisionero": "Born as the twin brother of El Arquero, the Prisoner Archer carries a past scarred by the Nazi era. Surviving the horrors of the Holocaust, he emerged with resilience and a newfound purpose. Unlike his brother and El Ballestador, who aligned with a malevolent faction, the Prisoner Archer chose the path of the Alliance, determined to oppose tyranny rather than serve it. His weapon of choice is the bow, adopted after witnessing his brother’s skill and vowing to defend himself and others with equal precision. During captivity, he secretly crafted crude fire arrows, though Nazi control forbade prisoners from wielding such weapons. This defiance became the seed of his mastery: when freedom came, he refined his skill into silent, lethal archery. Now, he stands as a guardian—swift, vigilant, and unyielding. If he sees his allies or the Alliance under attack, he will not hesitate to unleash a storm of arrows. His armor is light, built for speed and survival, allowing him to move across ruins and high structures with ease. He communicates through subtle signals, preferring silence over words, and rarely misses a shot. Upon defeat, he drops usable arrows, a reminder of his resourcefulness and the hardships he endured. Though his past is marked by sorrow, the Prisoner Archer fights forward with determination, embodying a hostile Robin Hood of the high ground. His story is one of survival, rebellion, and the relentless pursuit of justice—proof that even in the aftermath of tragedy, one can rise to protect others and continue the struggle for freedom.",

    "BallestadoraMusculosa": "Ballestadora Musculosa is stronger and more muscular than El Ballestador. They met on a training range where she was practicing with a simple bow and he was testing a crossbow; he noticed her discipline, offered direct guidance, and they started working together on distance shots. That cooperation became a relationship, and he taught her step by step: stances, timing, wind reading, and precision, moving from bow drills to crossbow routines. When he chose a dark path and joined a hostile faction, she ended the relationship and set clear goals: train harder, add muscle, and surpass him in strength and accuracy. She kept the lessons of precision and claimed the second crossbow that had been prepared as a backup, now her main weapon. She joined the Alliance and targets his faction without hesitation. Her shots are powerful and accurate, her endurance high, and her focus strict. What remains from the past is methodical ranged combat and the decision to be better than her former partner. Ballestadora Musculosa fights with muscle and conviction, stands as a loyal ally, and does not turn back to evil.",

    "WalterZombie": "Walter Zombie is a product of a catastrophic chemical mutation caused by the company CONASUPO, which was initially known for its dairy products. After accidentally consuming radioactive milk in 1986, the incident originated from the fallout of the Chernobyl disaster. Following the explosion in April 1986, radioactive material spread across Europe, resulting in acid rain that contaminated pastures in Ireland. Cows grazed on this tainted grass, leading to the production of radioactive milk, which was subsequently exported to Mexico. Defying the odds of death, Walter transformed into a hostile creature rather than succumbing to the effects of the radiation. However, unlike traditional zombies, he retained a measure of his intelligence and consciousness. In his quest to regain his human life, Walter allied himself with the Alianza group, seeking both redemption and a cure for his condition. Despite his aspirations, a second chemical treatment was administered to him, intended to end his existence as a zombie. Instead, it triggered an unexpected transformation into a Mamón (Tank) form, enhancing his physical prowess. This transformation occurs only during full or new moons, with a mere 0.5% chance of shifting into this formidable state. In this form, Walter becomes a more powerful adversary, capable of withstanding significant damage while still holding onto the hope of one day reclaiming his humanity. As he navigates this duality, Walter Zombie embodies the struggle between his monstrous instincts and the remnants of the man he once was.",
    "WalterZombieMamadisimo": "Walter Zombie Tank Form is an extreme mutation that only manifests during full or new moons with a 0.5% chance, meaning sometimes he transforms and other times he remains in his normal state. If provoked or if his Alianza group is attacked, and the player moves away around 10 blocks, he will relentlessly throw bombs until the enemy is destroyed, even sacrificing his own allies to eliminate those who threaten him. To defeat him, it is recommended to use a musket and a crossbow with explosive arrows, avoiding combat in his base or home since there is a high risk of him blowing up everything and ruining the player's effort.

    "AladinaCorrupta": "Aladina Corrupta was once a benevolent figure during the Arab Middle Ages, known for helping the poor and those in need. As the modern era arrived, she was excluded by the changing Arab system in Libya around the late 1800s, when the region was still under Ottoman control. Her decline worsened in the 20th century: by the 1990s Libya was under Muammar Gaddafi’s dictatorship, and her abilities weakened, no longer resembling her medieval strength. The fall of Gaddafi in 2011 brought further chaos instead of improvement. Witnessing civilians fighting for power, Aladina Corrupta reflected on years of suffering and began adopting techniques inspired by Arab militant groups, such as suicide attacks and bombings, though she never formally joined them. Ultimately, she aligned herself with the faction known as Muerte, driven by vengeance for the pain and mistreatment she endured. Now she feels a grim relief after joining Muerte. Unlike other members of the group, she has a distinctive attack: when an NPC or player targets her or her allies, she ignites a medium incendiary barrel. Distance does not matter—she will charge directly at the attacker, light the barrel, and give only five seconds to escape. Failure to flee results in being torn apart and blasted into the air. In her fury she even sacrifices her own companions, and herself, whenever the group is under attack.",

    "ElGuerrilleroTenebroso": "Alejandro Risaraldo Castillo, born into a guerrilla family within the FARC, chose to join them at the age of 8 by his own will. He gained experience until he met El Guerrillero, forming a special friendship. At 23 he retired without sadness, but sensed something was wrong. Disguised, he left the camp after hearing gunfire he mistook for pistols but were muskets, and discovered his friend allied with Muerte, fighting Alianza. El Guerrillero was wounded and his group lost, so Alejandro fled. Seeking sect ritual refuge, he asked a shaman to restore his friendship in exchange for his soul. The shaman set conditions: join Alianza and inform only a few of El Guerrillero’s closest friends and selected countryside comrades—never the entire group—to prevent a far worse conflict. He must also keep secret that he is aligned with Alianza, which is not police or armed forces, and reveal instead that El Guerrillero traded their friendship for another within Muerte, especially with the one who became most special to him. Alejandro accepted, deciding to hunt his friend to recover who he once was, while maintaining guerrilla tactics. It is said that he will appear on day 17 only at night.",
    "CamisasMorenas": "Camisas Morenas was born in Zacatecas, Mexico, from a humble family. He moved to Mexico City seeking better economic opportunities, where cartel wars still rage over territory. There he entered the world of the street markets, and on his birthday his uncle, the brother of his father, gifted him a stone machete. He kept it as a weapon of defense, to be used only if provoked to the extreme or if his belongings were stolen. He ran a stall selling shirts, but eventually abandoned the tianguis business when he joined a local gang, not part of the cartels but rooted in Mexico City itself. After many years of experience, the gang encountered a faction called Muerte and accepted their offer to unite. Camisas Morenas became hardened, using his machete as both symbol and weapon, and his reputation grew as someone who defended his group fiercely. Though he once dreamed of a simple life, his path led him deeper into conflict, and his loyalty to Muerte marked him as a dangerous figure. It is said that he will appear on day 21 at night.",
    "ZombieRepetidor": "Zombie Repetidor was once a human who lived in the Marshall Islands, especially on Bikini Atoll. He was of Ecuadorian origin, known as Elver Gonzalo Samboni, who traveled there seeking a new life. A skilled farmer, he specialized in fruits and vegetables, dedicating himself to his harvests. Everything changed drastically in 1954 when the United States detonated nuclear bombs on the islands. Residents were forced to abandon their homes to avoid death from the experiments, but Elver refused, believing it was all lies, and hid underground. When the explosions occurred, everyone thought he had died. The islands became desolate, uninhabitable due to radiation. Yet, against all odds, Elver survived. His skin became burned and rotten over the years, and he transformed into a zombie. This was partly due to a strange enchanted eggplant salad he had created, designed to revive him after explosions though only as a zombie. Despite his transformation, he remained alive and devised a way to return to Ecuador. He infiltrated a luxury boat bound for Ecuador, arriving in Atacames, and later returned to his hometown of Quito. There, he began eating junk food, which made him obese but also increased his muscular strength. One day, he decided to steal a Ballesta Repetidora to practice shooting, since he had no legal permits to own a firearm and stealing one could have cost him his life. He trained relentlessly until he became an expert marksman. Although he may look like just another common zombie, do not be fooled if he sees you, he will start shooting. Eventually, he allied himself with the group Muerte, becoming another deadly shooter. He will appear on day 13 at night.",
    "Sparkster": "Sparkster is the opossum Rocket Knight hero created by Konami, first appearing in Rocket Knight Adventures (1993) and continuing in Sparkster (1994) and later entries.

Midway in his lore here, Sparkster aligns with the Alianza, a protective group dedicated to defending allies and resisting corruption — he is non-hostile by default and only retaliates when provoked. Recognizable by his blue-and-red armor, Sparkster is brave, loyal, and resilient, excelling at fast movement and precise strikes while inspiring those around him. He will appear on Day 2 at any hour.",
    "Tulio": "Born in Santiago de Chile in 1995, during the post-Pinochet era, he grew up fascinated by fashion trends—jeans and striped shirts defined his style—and his curiosity about the world only grew stronger. At the age of 18, he chose not to attend the University of Santiago, preferring instead to dedicate himself to uncovering the truth behind the mysterious, unidentified Pacific islands. He had seen reports on TVN describing these islands, places that neither the United States nor Russia had managed to investigate despite their obsession. Rumors spread that only certain living beings could enter, and only they could learn the islands’ true origin. Determined, he sought illegal means to reach them, traveling to Easter Island in hopes of finding an abandoned boat to continue his journey. Fate intervened when violent winds and hurricanes struck, throwing him into the ocean. Yet nature itself seemed to protect him, carrying him safely to the very islands he sought. There he encountered both humans and non-humans—Naomi, Paco, El Marihuanero, El Marihuanero Mamón, and Ricardo. Together they formed a family, bound by survival and mystery. Eventually, he joined the group known as Alianza, dedicated to searching for survivors and uncovering the secrets of the Pacific islands. His journey became not only a quest for knowledge but also a testament to resilience, curiosity, and the strange destiny that united him with others on the islands.",
    "Brayan": "Brayan was born on January 12, 2000, in London, England. From a young age he dedicated himself to studying physics and biology, inspired by figures such as Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton. At the age of 25, he received a special voucher to travel to Alaska, United States, to further his studies of nature and frozen physics. He accepted, but during the journey an unexpected accident changed his life: the pilot fainted due to a natural cause, the plane lost control, and it crashed. Brayan survived thanks to the winds of nature, which carried him away from drowning and guided him to a mysterious island in the Pacific. From that moment, he began to survive using the knowledge he had acquired in his studies, applying physics and biology to endure the harsh environment. One day he met Tulio, who was impressed by Brayan’s survival methods and offered him the chance to join the group known as Alianza. This group was formed by people of good spirit, dedicated to protecting each other while collecting information about the unknown and mysterious islands. Brayan accepted, and from then on he became part of a family on the island, while keeping alive his hope of one day returning to England.",
    "Richard": "Richard is the twin brother of Ricardo. Unlike him, Richard was born in South Africa in 2004, during the post-apartheid era. When he turned 18, he began his life as an adventurer, driven by curiosity and a desire to explore the unknown. Later, he met Ricardo during a scientific journey in Mexico, and despite their different origins, they bonded deeply and became brothers in spirit. When Ricardo departed for the mysterious Pacific islands, Richard decided to undertake the same expedition, but with a unique difference: he designed and built a machine capable of traveling anywhere without the need for ships, boats, or conventional vehicles. His invention was a success, and he used it to embark on his journey, eventually arriving at the same destination as Ricardo. Upon reaching the island, Ricardo welcomed him as his true brother and introduced him to the companions he had met there. From that moment, Richard became part of the family and joined the group known as Alianza. His arrival brought new energy to the team, as his inventive mind and adventurous spirit complemented Ricardo’s resilience. Richard’s machine, though damaged during the voyage, became a symbol of hope for the group, showing that human ingenuity could rival even the mysteries of the islands. Together with Naomi, Paco, and the others, Richard contributed to the survival and exploration of the unknown land, strengthening the bonds of Alianza and keeping alive the dream of one day uncovering the secrets of the Pacific islands."

To use it, the operator must insert Flame Bullets as ammunition, then pull the trigger to unleash fire against enemy fortifications or groups of soldiers. The advantage is that it supports up to 15 rounds (15/15), giving the player sustained firepower before reloading.

  "Description": "A gas-operated, magazine-fed automatic shotgun with an open-bolt design. Originally designed by Maxwell Atchisson in 1972 for military and law enforcement applications, it fires 12-gauge shotgun shells at a rate of 300 RPM with a magazine capacity of 8 to 20 rounds depending on the magazine. Its bullpup configuration and improved recoil system significantly reduce felt recoil, allowing controllable automatic fire even with powerful ammunition. In this mod, it uses AA12Bullet cartridges and fires 8 pellets per shell, being devastating at close to medium range."
