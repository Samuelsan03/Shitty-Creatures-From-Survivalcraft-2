      "Title": "About This Shit Mod",
      "value": "This mod contains creatures of all kinds, stupid names and absurd descriptions, black humor, and unapologetic assholery. Some characters are inspired by TV shows, video games, books, or come directly from the creator's imagination. Expect nonsense, satire, and offensive stupidity. If you're looking for balance, lore consistency, or moral clarity, you're in the wrong place. This mod exists simply because someone thought it was funny enough to make. This mod was created on October 4, 2025, when the developer tried to make mods using a creature based on his own skin. He quickly realized it looked terrible—unoriginal and almost pirated. He abandoned the project for a month to focus on his wiki, Guns Mod, and Siyah Akrep on Fandom. Near the beginning of November 2025, he revived the mod, this time replacing the skin texture with one he imagined himself. That moment became his entry point into the world of Survivalcraft 2 modding. If you want to follow his messy progress, check out the YouTube channel called Felenork, or better yet, visit his GitHub profile under the name Samuelsan03 and look for the project titled 'Npc mod' to stay updated on future changes."
