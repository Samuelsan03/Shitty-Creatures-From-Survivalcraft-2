To save any changes, you must press 'Accept', or 'X' to discard. The spread and velocity settings determine the direction and distance of the projectiles.\n\nTo use it, simply hold right click if you are on PC, or hold the screen if you are on a mobile device, and it will automatically fire the times per second you have configured. Useful for shooting spawn eggs and generating creatures in large quantities in a short time.\n\nYou can also have fun launching fireworks or any other object.\n\n\nShitty code stolen by Samuelsan03, so do whatever you want with this code xd",

    "FlameThrower:0": {
      "DisplayName": "Flamethrower",
      "Description": "The flamethrower is an incendiary weapon designed to project controlled fire. It was invented by Richard Fiedler in 1901 and first used in combat by the German army in 1915 during World War I. It works by using a fuel tank (usually thickened gasoline or oil) and compressed gas to propel the burning stream through a nozzle with ignition. To use it, the operator must insert Flame Bullets as ammunition, then pull the trigger to unleash fire against enemy fortifications or groups of soldiers. The advantage is that it supports up to 15 rounds (15/15), giving the player sustained firepower before reloading. The Flame Bullet is the secondary ammunition: incendiary projectiles that complement the flamethrower, useful for ranged attacks and maintaining pressure on the enemy."

Compatible with multiple bolt types (Copper, Iron, Diamond, Explosive), each with distinct damage and effects. Automatic crossbow with 8-bolt magazine. Faster reload than normal crossbow but slightly less power."
