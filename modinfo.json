  "Description": "This mod is garbage, it just throws in creatures that are all sorts of: dark humor, stupid, real-life, game-related, and something like that. Why waste my time on this if I don't have any ideas? Just kidding. Sometimes the characters have absurd names and descriptions, and some models and textures were stolen from other mods, but I don't give a damn because I like making this shitty mod for fun rather than wasting my time giving credit to other random people who created their mods. I don't know if you understand, or if not, go to hell LOL",
